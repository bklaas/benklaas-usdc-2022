# findSearchTermInBooks

Included in this repository are files to support candidates applying for software engineering roles through the GSA's US Digital Corps program. 

There are three files in this repository we would like you to focus on:

1. This README.
1. `tester.html`: An HTML file that will run your code.
1. `book_search.js`: A JavaScript source code file that you should edit for your inverview submission.

## Testing your code via browser

You will need to open the file `tester.html` in a browser to run the code that is contained in `book_search.js`. The output from running that code will appear in the browser's web developer console. Here is documentation for opening the web developer tools for Firefox:

https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/browser_console/index.html#:~:text=You%20can%20open%20the%20Browser,%2B%20J%20on%20a%20Mac

And here are the instructions for Google Chrome:

https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/

Either should work; we tested under both on Mac and Linux.

You will submit both the HTML and JavaScript files when you are done. You should not need to edit `tester.html`. We expect all of your work to appear in the file `book_search.js`. 

## Testing your code via Visual Studio Code

If you'd like to test your code in Visual Studio Code, there is a small amount of setup but it does provide a development environment that yields faster debugging iterations.

- Install Visual Studio Code
- Install Node.js
- Open the repository in Visual Studio Code
- Open the Terminal pane (View->Terminal), and then select DEBUG CONSOLE 
- From the file browser on the left, open book_search.js
- To run the code, either select Run->Start Debugging, or (faster) hit F5 
- Console log output and runtime errors should now display in the DEBUG CONSOLE

Once setup, you can iterate by making changes in the editor to book_search.js, saving your changes, and then again hitting F5 and viewing the output in DEBUG CONSOLE.

## Submission

Directions for submission are in the prompt. As a reminder, you should commit your code to a repository called

*firstnamelastname*-usdc-2022

If you were remarkable technologists of years past, you might name your repository

`otisboykin-usdc-2022`

or 

`mariebrown-usdc-2022`

You, of course, should name your repository for the remarkable technologist of civic tech's future that you are.
